# VirtualDOM

This small library was to rebuild the Virtual DOM concept of React.
Feel Free to clone it and have fun with it.

There's no React in this repository only Babel to transpile JSX, and Webpack to
build and make a server.

Clone this repo, install dependencies, then start with the following:

```
	> git clone https://github.com/Prattjames/VirtualDOM.git
